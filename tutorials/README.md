# Tutorials

These tutorials can be run via MyBinder.org without installing anything on your local computer. 
There are just a few steps needed to get this working.

* Click [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bernhard-42/jupyter-cadquery/master?urlpath=lab&filepath=examples%2Fcadquery.ipynb) to open a Jupyter Lab instance with jupyter-cadquery extension installed.
* Wait until the workbook loads. This can take awhile.
* Open a Python 3 console.
* Paste `! git clone https://github.com/jmwright/cadquery-contrib.git` in the code cell and hit the Shift+Enter keys.
* Once you see "Unpacking objects...done" in the output, you should see a `cadquery-contrib` directory in the left sidebar.
* Close the console.
* Drill down into `cadquery-contrib/tutorials` and click on `Ex000 Start Here.ipynb`.
* Enjoy
