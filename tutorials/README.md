# Tutorials

These tutorials can be run via MyBinder.org without installing anything on your local computer. 
There are just a few steps needed to get this working.

* Click [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bernhard-42/jupyter-cadquery/master) to open a Jupyter Lab instance with the jupyter-cadquery extension installed.
* Drill down into the `examples` directory and click on the `install-cadquery-contrib.ipynb` workbook.
* Wait until the workbook loads. This could take some time if the workbook needs to be built from scratch.
* Execute the code cell containing `! git clone https://github.com/jmwright/cadquery-contrib.git` by clicking on it and pressing the Shift+Enter keys.
* Once you see "Unpacking objects...done" in the output, you should see a `cadquery-contrib` directory in the left sidebar.
* Drill down into the `cadquery-contrib/tutorials` directory and click on `Ex000 Start Here.ipynb`.
* Enjoy
