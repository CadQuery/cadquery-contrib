If you hold your hand open with the palm facing up, your thumb will point in the positive X direction, your fingers in the positive Y direction, and up from your palm will be the positive Z direction. Other [named views](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classreference.html#cadquery.Workplane) can be passed to `Workplane` as well, such as \"front\" and \"XZ\". A workplane is like a virtual surface on which you can place geometry that you use while building your model.

The box will be centered around the origin by default, but this behavior can be overridden by passing the `centered` parameter. Additional information about the box method can be found [here](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classreference.html#cadquery.Workplane.box). CadQuery also has other primitives, including [sphere](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classreference.html#cadquery.Workplane.sphere) and [wedge](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classreference.html#cadquery.Workplane.wedge) which are covered in the documentation."

    "One other thing to note about this line of code is that the box method is tacked on directly after the `Workplane` call. This chaining is enabled by the fact that most high level CadQuery methods return CQ objects. This leads to very compact code, although chaining too many calls together can make your code harder to read. Oftentimes you will want to break chains down into logical operations that build on one another. Some CadQuery methods will alter the CQ object in place rather than returning a new object, so it is best to consult the documentation for a method to ensure that you are using it properly."
