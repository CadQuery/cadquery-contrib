* [Braille.py](examples/Braille.py) - Configurable braille label/sign generator where user inputs text and the braille dots are generated automatically
* [Classic_OCC_Bottle.py](examples/Classic_OCC_Bottle.py) - Standard OCCT bottle example, implemented using the CadQuery API
* [Numpy.py](examples/Numpy.py) - Example of integrating Numpy with CadQuery
* [Panel_with_Various_Holes_for_Connector_Installation.py](examples/Panel_with_Various_Holes_for_Connector_Installation.py) - Example of creating various knock-out holes in a panel
* [Parametric_Enclosure.py](examples/Parametric_Enclosure.py) - Standard CadQuery example of an electronics enclosure with a base, fastener bosses, and a lid
* [Reinforce_Junction_UsingFillet.py](examples/Reinforce_Junction_UsingFillet.py) - Example of using fillets to reinforce a joint, reducing stress concentrators at the joint
* [Remote_Enclosure.py](examples/Remote_Enclosure.py) - An electronics enclosure created to be mounted on motorcycle handlebars
* [Resin_Mold.py](examples/Resin_Mold.py) - A resin casting mold created to repair the strain-relief on an expensive cable
